#+TITLE: Topgrade Config

[[https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade][Topgrade]] is a great tool for updating all package managers on your system. It's
freaking awesome to say the very least. Supports doom, tmux, vim, yarn, tldr and
others. I can recommend it.

* Config file
:PROPERTIES:
:header-args: :tangle topgrade.toml :padline yes
:END:

** Assume yes
#+BEGIN_SRC toml
assume_yes = true
#+END_SRC
** Cleanup
After running it should cleanup all files, if possible
#+begin_src toml
cleanup = true
#+end_src
